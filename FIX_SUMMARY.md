# Transform Fix Summary

## Problem
The original model achieved 73.81% validation accuracy but only 3.96% test accuracy - a massive overfitting issue.

## Root Cause
Data augmentation transforms were configured but **never actually applied** during training because:
1. Transform classes inherited from `nn.Module` and checked `if not self.training:`
2. These modules were never put into training mode, so `self.training` was always `False`
3. As a result, all transforms returned the input unchanged

## Solution
Removed the `self.training` check from transform classes in `src/data/transforms.py`:
- `RandomRotation3D` (disabled for MPS compatibility anyway)
- `RandomScale3D` ✓ (now working)
- `RandomNoise3D` ✓ (now working)

## Verification
Running `test_transforms.py` confirms transforms are now being applied:
```
✅ SUCCESS: Samples are different - transforms are being applied!

Transforms in pipeline:
  - RandomScale3D
  - RandomNoise3D
```

## Expected Results
With proper augmentation, we expect:
- Test accuracy: 60-70% (realistic for ModelNet10)
- Validation-Test gap: <10%
- Better generalization across all classes

## Training Command
```bash
cd src && python train.py --config ../configs/default.yaml
```

The model is now retraining with working augmentation using the original training infrastructure.
